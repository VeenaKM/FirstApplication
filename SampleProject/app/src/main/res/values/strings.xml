    <string name="default_text">Shared Element Transitions are a great way of implementing Material motion and adding some
        flair to your app. Shared element transitions help the user on their journey through your app by giving them a
        focal point as they go from screen to screen. They can make your app feel like a whole, rather than a bunch of
        separate screens slapped together. They shouldn't be abused though, in some case too many elements darting all
        over the screen may make the user feel a bit motion sick!</string>
